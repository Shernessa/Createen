<p class = "uno"> Shernessa Joseph, who is of Saint Lucian nationality, is a diligent 14-year-old student of the Vieux Fort Comprehensive
Secondary School; one of the most prestigious secondary schools on island. She express herself through creative means such as writing, painting and
photography among other things.</p>
<p class= "uno"> "As a teen photorapher in Saint Lucia, I felt that older folk, especially, overlooked my talent. I was rarely taken seriously
  when I approached other photographers asking to collaborate. I came to realize that I was not th eonly one suffering from this issue. I have
  witnessed a lot of talent being wasted and going unwasted. I decided to make a creativespace for teenagers which allows us to showcase our work,
  give each other feedback, help each other improve and ultimately, establish our place in our various industries." </p>
