    <h2 class= "one"> Problem Statement: </h2>
    <p class= "dos"> There is a lack of appreciation for the arts in Saint Lucia especially when produced by teenagers.
    It is often overlooked and deemd as merely a "hobby" or "past-time". </p>
  <p class= "dos"> Older folk fail to realize that teenagers can forge real careers from their talents.</p>
<br>
  <h2 class= "one"> Mission Statement: </h2>
  <p class= "dos">  To unite teenagers in the community, allow them to network and improve their skills so that they become comfortable with showcasing it. </p>
<br>
<h2 class= "one"> Who Are We? </h2>
<p class= "dos"> We are an organization which allows Saint Lucian teenagers to showcase their work, improve their skills and network with each other as well as bigger names in the local art industry.</p>
<p class= "dos"> We are inclusive of visual artists (photographers, videographers, graphic designers etc.), people involved in the performing arts (singers/songwriters, dancers, musicians etc.), content creators etc.</p>
